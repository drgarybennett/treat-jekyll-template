[Nice piece](http://now.tufts.edu/articles/not-so-bite-sized) describing a new Tuft&#8217;s study. It found:

> An average [restaurant] meal contained two to three times the estimated caloric needs of an adult for a single meal, and 66 percent of typical daily calorie requirements.

Translation: restaurant food is fattening. 

That&#8217;s not new news per se. We&#8217;ve known for a while that obesity rates are being driven heavily by the increasing amount of foods that we consume away from home. This study just shows the size of the problem. 

I&#8217;ve been wondering about this a lot lately.My favorite local restaurant has a chef&#8217;s table that overlooks its kitchen. For some reason, the table isn&#8217;t very popular, so my wife and I can sit for hours watching and eating (and then, tipping well). The organized chaos of a restaurant kitchen is something to behold. So much said between cooks, much more left unsaid, and lots and lots of butter. And salt. In everything. Fish? Add butter and salt. Chicken? Butter and salt. Veggies? Butter. Oh, and salt. 

Apparently, this is why nothing tastes as good when I make it at home. It&#8217;s also why I&#8217;ll stay employed for a while.
