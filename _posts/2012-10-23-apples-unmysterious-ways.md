In case you haven&#8217;t heard, there&#8217;s a big Apple event today. 

It&#8217;s amazing that the Apple events have become [[almost completely] formulaic](http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/1758.html). Moreover, we all [know what&#8217;s coming](http://m.imore.com/ipad-mini-preview-redux) and yet, we watch. 

Has there ever been a better archetype for brand allegiance?
