I&#8217;m a faculty member in the clinical psychology program at Duke. This time of year, I get lots of questions about whether I&#8217;m taking a student and what I&#8217;m looking for. I posted my answers (to those and a host of other unasked questions re graduate study) [here.](http://www.dukeobesity.org/?p=161) It&#8217;s probably bad to quote yourself, but:

> For better or worse, many graduate programs still utilize the apprentice training model. This means that you will spend at least the next four years working very closely with a research mentor to develop the skills necessary to pursue an independent research career. Here is a universal truth about graduate study:** _if the fit with your mentor stinks, your graduate experience will too_**.
