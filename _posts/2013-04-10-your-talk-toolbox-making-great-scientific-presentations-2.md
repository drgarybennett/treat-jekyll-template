_This is the second post in a series on scientific presentation design._

> In a paper, give me enough to draw my own interpretations. In a presentation, give me **your** interpretation.

If there&#8217;s anything I&#8217;ve learned in a decade of giving scientific presentations, it&#8217;s this: the software doesn&#8217;t make the slides, **you do**.
  
It&#8217;s true, [Keynote will help you make better looking presentations](http://drgarybennett.com/2013/04/09/making-great-scientific-presentations-part-1/) than does PowerPoint. But to really unleash Keynote&#8217;s power (and your own creative energy), you need a broader assortment of tools. Here are mine:

### Stock images

Let&#8217;s start this discussion with a healing cleanse. Try this:

  * Breathe in deeply, expanding your diaphragm, holding your core steady.
  * Search your hard drive for all &#8220;clip art.&#8221;
  * Select all. Press delete.
  * Release the air slowly and resume your activities.

OK, now let&#8217;s proceed. Good presentations start [and usually end] with good images. I don&#8217;t mean cartoons. You know the maxim: &#8220;a picture is worth a thousand words?&#8221;

It&#8217;s true.

It doesn&#8217;t apply to cartoons.

Most presenters can greatly reduce their use of on-slide text by using a strong image-based background. That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m recommending that you reject the template.

Let&#8217;s face it. Most templates are hideous. They constrain creativity and are mostly designed for uses _other_ than science. So why do we use them? I suspect most think: 1) they help with marketing, 2) by standardizing the background, people will focus on the content, 3) it&#8217;s convention, 4) we don&#8217;t know any alternative testing approaches.

If you believe #1-3, let&#8217;s talk. Otherwise, keep reading.

Imagine that you&#8217;re doing a talk on poverty, health inequities, children&#8217;s health, or global health. How about this as your background?

Or, this:

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-589" src="http://drgarybennett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/473470_64950954-300x199.jpg" alt="473470_64950954" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://drgarybennett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/473470_64950954-300x199.jpg 300w, http://drgarybennett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/473470_64950954-1024x680.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://drgarybennett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/473470_64950954.jpg)

These images look great, but that&#8217;s not all. See how each contains open space for text? That makes them ideal backgrounds.

Here&#8217;s how I used an image in a recent talk.

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-591" src="http://drgarybennett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-10-at-9.06.15-AM-300x223.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-10 at 9.06.15 AM" width="300" height="223" srcset="http://drgarybennett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-10-at-9.06.15-AM-300x223.png 300w, http://drgarybennett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-10-at-9.06.15-AM-1024x763.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://drgarybennett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-10-at-9.06.15-AM.png)

(Incidentally, this is a good example of a slide is still **way too** text heavy. More on that next time).

So, where do you get these great images? There are tons of great search sites for royalty-free images, but I use [**everystockphoto.com**](http://everystockphoto.com). The site searches a bunch of repositories for stock photos. All are free for non-commercial use (be sure to check the rights statements, but in most cases you can acknowledge the photographer in the slide notes).

**Pro tip:** Always search for the largest image possible. Large size usually means high resolution. Because your slide is likely to be projected on a large screen, you want to make sure that it isn&#8217;t pixelated. If it&#8217;s only available in a small size (say, smaller than 1024&#215;768), move on.

## Design inspiration

When you get stuck (and even before getting there, check out [**Note and Point**](http://noteandpoint.com/). There are great presentations here, on a wide range of topics. Those in the tech world often have fewer constraints than we do, so ignore the content and focus on the design.

## Typography

Why use Times New Roman or Arial or Cambria? Just like the right image, a strong font can greatly improve the &#8220;feel&#8221; &#8212; not to mention the readability &#8212; of your your slide text.

There&#8217;s been surge of interest in typography, with enough font options to make you dizzy. Easiest option? Head over to [**Google Fonts**](http://www.google.com/fonts/) where you&#8217;ll find tons of font choices (and a nice preview interface). Note that Google Fonts is primarily intended to make it easy to use great typography on the web. To use a font in your presentation, click the download arrow on the upper right side of the screen. Install your font and your presentation will read as good as it looks.

## Video

One should use video sparingly, but it can be hugely effective. My favorite design device &#8212; setting a video as my slide&#8217;s background. The video moves in the background behind [just a little] text. I often use this to show people using our digital health technologies, while descriptive text appears in the foreground.

Let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;d like to include some stock video from YouTube. Of course, they don&#8217;t make it easy to download videos (given concerns re copyright infringement). So what to do if you want to use video in a non-commercial scientific talk?

**Pro tip**: Add &#8220;pwn&#8221; in front of the regular YouTube URL (e.g. youtube.com/lorem becomes pwnyoutube.com/lorem).

Now that you have the right toolbox, you&#8217;re _almost_ ready.
