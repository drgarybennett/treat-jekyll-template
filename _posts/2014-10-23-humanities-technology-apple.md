I&#8217;ve long been interested in Steve Jobs&#8217; approach to design. True, I&#8217;m a bit of an [Apple fan-person](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fanboy), but my appreciation for the _Apple Way_ runs deeper than that. I constantly struggle with my approach to developing digital health technologies. Is it theoretically-grounded, using evidence-based approaches, technically sound, adopting optimal user experience practices, gathering the right amount of patient feedback and so on.

Jobs&#8217; approach was different. He knew what he liked and he thought we should (vs would) too. And he was right.

I knew that Jobs&#8217; liked pretty things, but I hadn&#8217;t tied it to his love of the humanities. [This Brian Lehrer interview of Walter Isaacson](http://www.wnyc.org/story/walter-isaacson-innovation/) is a must listen. They cover a range of topics but most interesting is Isaacson&#8217;s argument that Jobs&#8217; love of the humanities pushed him to create mashups of great technology and humanistic design principles.

It&#8217;s a good reminder for all of us who do this work.
