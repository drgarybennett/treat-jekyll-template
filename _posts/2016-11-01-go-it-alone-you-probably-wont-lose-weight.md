Nice [NY Times piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/health/americans-obesity-willpower-genetics-study.html?_r=0) from Gina Kolata, amplifying the findings from today&#8217;s [University of Chicago poll](http://www.norc.org/PDFs/ASMBS%20Obesity/Issue%20Brief%20B_ASMBS%20NORC%20Obesity%20Poll.pdf) on obesity. 

> The self-help route has not been successful for most. Ninety-four percent of the survey participants who were obese had tried to lose weight with diet or exercise, to no avail. A quarter of those people said they had tried five to nine times, and 15 percent said they had tried more than 20 times.
> 
> “Trying 20 times and not succeeding — is that lack of willpower, or a problem that can’t be treated with willpower?” asked Dr. Louis Aronne, the director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, who was not involved with the study.

Too many Americans (read: most all of us) are attempting weight loss using approaches that have **no** evidence base. Upwards of 1 in 5 American deaths is related to obesity. Obesity causes a wide range of health conditions that sap our physical function, quality of life, and money. And yet, we&#8217;ve become all too comfortable treating obesity with what amounts to well intentioned snake oil. I challenge you to think of another chronic disease where we embrace treatments that, well, don&#8217;t work. 

How did we get here? Too little training in med school, too little [and otherwise anemic] treatment reimbursement policies, research that focuses on scaling outcomes vs scaling treatments, and lots and lots of stigma. 

We have to do better.
