**_Part of our ongoing, intermittent, and highly speculative series about what&#8217;s next in digital health_**

Invisible apps are what&#8217;s next in digital health. [These](https://www.producthunt.com/@rrhoover/collections/invisible-apps?utm_source=Product+Hunt&utm_campaign=80311e9b2a-Invisible_Apps2_16_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_2cd7d34185-80311e9b2a-121141841) are some of the best.

We&#8217;ve yet to see many invisible apps for digital health. But they&#8217;re clearly what&#8217;s next. As design focused as I am, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly clear that we can develop usable, sticky apps without graphical interfaces (there&#8217;s a trend to call these no-UI apps, but graphics do not an interface make).

Our studies show that we can achieve 12-month engagement of 84% engagement with a health app that&#8217;s delivered via interactive voice response and text. This means that 84% of participants will text or voice us at least weekly for a year.

Compare that to [my rule of 70](http://drgarybennett.com/2014/11/14/its-hard-out-here-for-an-app/) which, in part says, most of your app&#8217;s users won&#8217;t come back for a second try.

Plus, these invisible apps have huge reach (91% of us text), lower cost (thanks [Twilio](http://twilio.com)), are easier to code (notifications APIs rock), and are easier on the MVP budget.
