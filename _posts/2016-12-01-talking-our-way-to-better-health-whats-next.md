I&#8217;ve been dictating papers, notes, emails for more than 15 years (and have a copy of Dragon Naturally Speaking v1 and a closet full of mics to prove it). Some of you know that I regularly dot my spoken langauge with dictation hyphen speak comma and frequently don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m doing it exclamation mark.

So, I think there is great potential for the voice interface movement (see the Amazon Echo, Siri, Cortana, etc) to revolutionize the way that we interact with technology. We&#8217;re still in that early haphazard phase, in which companies are trying to inject voice into every box, app, tool, and small animal monitoring device &#8212; all to see what sticks. This is pretty common in the lifecycle of new technologies (see wearables &#8212; who exactly needs [pulse ox](http://drgarybennett.com/2014/04/01/here-comes-healthbook/)), and I think we&#8217;ll soon see that voice interfaces have huge potential in digital health. Voice will help us improve accessibility, a much overlooked challenge for digital health apps. But just imagine the improvements we can make in hard-to-monitor factors like eating, activity, symptoms, and mood.

And with price points dropping on voice tools (like Amazon&#8217;s Echo Dot), there is potential to make voice entry ubiquitous.

(This is not an Amazon commercial &#8212; really &#8212; but) Amazon is making it easier than ever to make conversational voice (and text) agents with their new [Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-lex-build-conversational-voice-text-interfaces/) framework.

I&#8217;ve played with several similar frameworks, but the sophistication in the language parsing, interoperability, flexibility (same logic for Messenger or Twilio), and cost efficiencies really makes Lex standout.

Next time, #thinktwicebeforeyouapp and go voice.
