Netflix just announced that it will allow parents (yup, any parent) to take [unlimited parental leave](http://blog.netflix.com/2015/08/starting-now-at-netflix-unlimited.html?utm_source=SitePoint&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Versioning). We should applaud Netflix for instituting such a humane, family-friendly, productivity enhancing, loyalty inspiring, and [likely] cost saving policy for all parents &#8211; just like my [employer](http://www.duke.edu).

That said, it&#8217;s sad that these announcements still make news.
