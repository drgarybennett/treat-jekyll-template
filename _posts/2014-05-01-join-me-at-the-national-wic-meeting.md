I&#8217;ll be speaking at the upcoming [National WIC Association meeting](https://www.nwica.org/events/info/annual-education-and-networking-conference-exhibits) in Pittsburgh, PA on Tuesday May 20, 3:30-4:30pm. I&#8217;ll be performing an acoustic version of my favorite standard:

_When Obesity Becomes the Norm, What Do We Do?_

I&#8217;m sure you know WIC, but for the other 2 of you:

> The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is a public health nutrition program under the USDA providing nutrition education, nutritious foods, breastfeeding support, and healthcare referrals for income-eligible women who are pregnant or post-partum, infants, and children up to age 5.

Hope to see you there.
