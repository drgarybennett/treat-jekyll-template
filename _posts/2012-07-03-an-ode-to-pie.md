Trust me &#8212; no one likes an obesity researcher at a dinner party.

The funny thing is that obesity researchers are some of the foodiest foodies I know (and not just for grass-y dishes).

That&#8217;s why IÂ **love** <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/archives/archive.php?thingId=155350353" target="_blank">NPRs &#8220;Pie Week.&#8221;</a> It&#8217;s a reminder that there&#8217;s a place in the American diet for well-made, butter-laden, flaky goodness.

Just don&#8217;t [do like me, and] <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/10/apple-pie-cookies/" target="_blank">take it to the extreme</a>.
