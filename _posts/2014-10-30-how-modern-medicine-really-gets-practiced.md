We conduct digital health research trials almost exclusively in community health centers. These primary care settings are described as part of the nation&#8217;s &#8220;safety net,&#8221; but let&#8217;s be clear: for most of these patients, there is no catcher on the trapeze. Health centers are the primary, primary care option for our nation&#8217;s poor. Without them, we&#8217;d be certain to see [even more] rampant rates of suffering, poverty, and health care costs.

Health center docs are some of the most amazing physicians you&#8217;ll ever encounter. While I&#8217;m somewhat prone to hyperbole, I&#8217;m probably understating this particular point. Need evidence? [This episode](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/working/2014/10/david_plotz_talks_to_a_washington_family_practice_doctor_about_obesity_well.html) from [David Plotz&#8217;s](http://www.twitter.com/davidplotz) wonderful new podcast series aptly captures the amazing gifts that health center physicians provide to their patients [and our nation].
