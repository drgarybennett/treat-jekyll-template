I&#8217;ll be at tonight&#8217;s Health 2.0 event, [Community Madness &#8211; What is Connected Care?](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/community-madness-what-is-connected-care-tickets-11023474509?aff=eorg), performing songs from my new album: _How digital health broke weight loss (and what we can do about it)_

Hope to see you there.
