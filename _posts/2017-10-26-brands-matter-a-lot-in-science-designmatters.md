From [Daniel Kahneman](https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/), winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics (technically the The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences) and originator of the field of behavioral economics (a.k.a., hottest thing going these days).

> I’d like to observe that the term “behavioral economics,” as it is used today&#8230;that’s really social psychology&#8230; It’s principles about how to affect behavior. And it is remarkable, and some people find it sad, that social psychology had to disguise itself as economics before it had an impact on the culture.

> And that’s because economics has a better brand than psychology.

Maybe Justice Roberts might rethink his view of sociology as [&#8220;sociological gobbledygook&#8221;](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/10/04/justice-roberts-said-political-science-is-sociological-gobbledygook-heres-why-he-said-it-and-why-hes-mistaken/) if we just decided to call it socio-statistical finance?
