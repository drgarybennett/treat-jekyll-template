Nice [new study](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1195521) from Brian Wansink&#8217;s group at Cornell. The study provides evidence for some practices that we&#8217;re already recommending&#8230;

First, don&#8217;t fast. You&#8217;ll overeat as a result.

Next, design eating environments so that high carb foods aren&#8217;t easy first choices. People &#8212; particularly fasters &#8212; are more likely to choose those high carb foods. And then, eat a [whole lot] more of them.

Finally, breakfast is critical for successful weight loss and maintenance. As my buddy Yoda would say, &#8220;Choose wisely, you must.&#8221; (excuse the geek-out)
