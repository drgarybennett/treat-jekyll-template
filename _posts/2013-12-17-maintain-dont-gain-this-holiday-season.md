I recently started blogging at the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gary-g-bennett-/). [My first post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gary-g-bennett-/weight-loss-tips_b_4399155.html) outlines the basics of our &#8220;maintain, don&#8217;t gain&#8221; approach. Why prevent weight gain this holiday season? Because most of us don&#8217;t have enough motivation to do the things that are necessary to lose weight:

> [Weight loss] doesn&#8217;t take a little bit of motivation, it takes a lot. More than most of us think. And by motivation, I don&#8217;t mean interest in losing weight. Most of us have that. No, you need enough motivation to track everything you&#8217;re eating in detail, be physically active every day, portion out your food, practice behavioral weight-loss skills, set goals, problem solve, engage your supporters (while ignoring the haters), and get back on track when you slip off.</p>
