Really nice basic behavioral [research study](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120710093812.htm#.T_1CZXWN8kA.twitter) showing that posting simple messages within eyeshot (e.g., on menus, doors of businesses, menu boards) can positively change eating behaviors.

Interesting summary from Science Daily:

> This technique has great potential as an intervention to help weight control &#8212; it is unobtrusive, easy to implement and low in cost making it attractive to policy makers.

(Oh, how I wish policy makers paid attention to research findings&#8230;) In the meantime, the dissemination question is how to develop priming messages that influence eating behaviors **and** appeal to business owners. Figure out how to shift eating behaviors to more healthful, higher margin foods and you may have something.
