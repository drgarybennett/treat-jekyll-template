(It’s funny how far we haven’t come, no?)

Hoping to build search interface on your new health app? [This should be your <del>inspiration </del>goal](http://s.codepen.io/designcouch/debug/YXRvbz?utm_source=SitePoint&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Versioning).

Forget all that you _can_ do with a quantified self-style interface. People want answers. _Not_ more numbers, figures, charts, and talking avatars. Imagine an interface that allowed people to ask things like:

  * Am I exercising enough?
  * How long is it going to take me to lose 10lb?
  * How much weight should I lose to get off this blood pressure pill?
