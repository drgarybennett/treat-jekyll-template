Finally, the Feds have clearly indicated that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-obesity-screening-20120622,0,2815818.story" target="_blank">obese patients should be screened and treated</a>. There&#8217;s a lot more to say about this (and I will), but for now, it&#8217;s worth noting the comment from Jeffrey Levi, from the <a href="http://healthyamericans.org/pages/?id=67" target="_blank">Trust for America&#8217;s Health</a>.

> Few have the time or resources to provide obese patients with intensive counseling, he said.

He&#8217;s right. My physician colleagues are too busy and too stretched to take a primary role in coordinating obesity treatment. They have an important role to play, but relying on physicians to deliver weight loss counseling is inconsistent with the evidence, which doesn&#8217;t show particularly strong outcomes for physician-delivered weight loss treatment. Besides that, it ignores the fact that obesity treatment is optimally delivered by ancillary care providers (e.g., registered dietitians, psychologists, nurses) who have the requisite training, fewer capacity constraints, _and_ are less costly than physicians. What we need are strategies like those used in the NHLBI-funded POWER trials, in which care is delivered by a broad range of providers &#8212; physicians and non-physicians alike.
