Have you ever been reading a blog post and thought (usually in the first paragraph) that, &#8220;this guy/gal is going to get bashed for saying this.&#8221;

You&#8217;re about to think that.

We just got news that Taco Bell – the veritable purveyor of &#8220;meat&#8221; filled &#8220;Mexican&#8221;-inspired delights &#8212; is selling 1 million of its Doritos Loco&#8217;s tacos… each day.

For those of you who haven&#8217;t had the pleasure: the Doritos Locos is to a Dorito what the iPad is to the iPhone. A big Dorito (con taco &#8220;meat&#8221;) that they&#8217;re selling 1 million times each day.

_Let me first acknowledge that, while I was a Doritos lover as a child and experimented with Taco Bell on a low-carb personal experiment a few years back (a story for another day), I have not yet actually consumed one of these._

You might think that reports of rampant Doritos Locos consumption would promote a 5,000 word rant against the ills of fast food and &#8220;meat.&#8221; Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not going there. [Here&#8217;s the part that will make me a bashee] 

Truth is – I&#8217;m not anti-fast food. I&#8217;m anti bad fast food. And the Doritos Locos taco isn&#8217;t that bad. Hear me &#8212; it isn&#8217;t good, but it could be [much, much] worse.

Hear&#8217;s how it breaks down: [table caption=&#8221;Nutritional Content of Doritos Locos&#8221; width=&#8221;600&#8243; colwidth=&#8221;100|200|200&#8243; colalign=&#8221;left|center|center&#8221;] ,Doritos Locos,Doritos Locos Supreme

So, as far as fast food goes, this is not too bad. The challenge: not having more than about 2 tacos. A 400cal lunch is pretty good for the general public and maybe a bit on the high side for someone who is actively attempting to lose weight. The problem is really the sodium content. Sodium is excessively high in most all fast food (usually much higher than for these tacos). This is a topic for another day, but Americans consume far too much sodium on a daily basis. Two Doritos Locos Supremes will give you about a third of your recommended daily sodium intake (2300mg). By usual fast food standards, that&#8217;s actually pretty good. Let&#8217;s look at other popular fast food items: [table caption=&#8221;Sodium in Other Fast Food&#8221; width=&#8221;600&#8243; colwidth=&#8221;250|250&#8243; colalign=&#8221;left|center|center&#8221;] ,,


  
McDonald&#8217;s Hamburger,570mg
  
Chick-Fil-A Chicken Sandwich,1400mg
  
Subway&#8217;s Spicy Italian Sandwich, 1520mg
  
Chipotle&#8217;s Burrito,2650mg
  
Chick-Fil-A Nuggets,1090mg
  
McDonald&#8217;s Chicken McNuggets,360mg
  
[/table] 

So, not great, but if you&#8217;re going to have fast food, having two of these would not be the end of the world.

There&#8217;s another tricky policy issue that Taco Bell&#8217;s success raises. More on that soon.
