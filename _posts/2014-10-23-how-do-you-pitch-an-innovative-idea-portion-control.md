One of the key challenges in a new-ish area like digital health is not being _too_ innovative when pitching new ideas. [This piece](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/why-new-ideas-fail/381275/2/) from Derek Thompson does a great job of explaining the challenge:

> Knowledge doesn’t just turn us into critical thinkers. It maybe turns us into over-critical thinkers.

That&#8217;s absolutely been my experience &#8212;  in NIH study section meetings, product pitches, and brainstorming sessions.

Thompson&#8217;s solution? Portion control.

> Most people really don&#8217;t like new ideas that sound entirely new, particularly the experts that often have to approve them. The trick is learning to frame new ideas as old ideas—to make your creativity seem, well, not quite so creative.
