Not another app. There I said it [again]. The market is crowded and science can&#8217;t (and shouldn&#8217;t) compete on design, updates, integrations, marketing, etc. 

So what is there for a behavioral digital health scientist to do? 

Answer the tricky, confounding, unanswerable questions that are constraining the growth and utility of digital health.

Like this. 

Vanessa Friedman wrote [great piece](http://nyti.ms/1TavL58) in the Times last week about breaking up with her Apple Watch (I&#8217;ll take it). Amidst her litany of concerns was this:

> Likewise&#8230;the fitness-app aspect — the tracking of my steps, the measuring of my heart rate, the telling me to stand up when I am in the middle of an article — seems more like a burden than freedom&#8230;I have worked hard to wean myself from a reliance on exercise machines telling me how hard I had worked&#8230;because I knew I was cheating pretty much all the time anyway and thus could not trust the results, and in part because it became an excuse to modify, or not, my ensuing behavior&#8230;But the truth is, I know when I am in shape&#8230; The watch threatened to drag me back into a numbers-driven neurosis, and that’s a temptation I would rather not have. 

Her comments are no surprise for anyone who&#8217;s helped a patient to change her behavior (especially the masses who aren&#8217;t interested in the quantified self approach). It&#8217;s dangerous to treat anecdotes as data, but I suspect her experience is widely shared. I&#8217;ve yet to meet a patient who was motivated by the reams of data that we scientists like to provide. 

So, how do we fix this? That&#8217;s the question.
