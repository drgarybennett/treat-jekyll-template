Thanks for all of the messages asking whether I will be taking a student next year.

Short answer: I am not committing to taking a student, but I will be reviewing applications. [Here&#8217;s who we&#8217;re looking for](http://drgarybennett.com/2015/08/17/am-i-taking-a-student-in-2016/). (Thanks @Hoyaheel22)

Good luck!
