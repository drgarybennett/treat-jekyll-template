In this week&#8217;s addition of _Another Day, Another Wearable_, we present the latest offering from [Pivotal Living](http://www.pivotalliving.com/#!device/c1sre).

![c9464e_b76da95d89af4e8ea229a8b04a7edf6a.png_srz_384_390_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_png_srz](https://draftin.com:443/images/22979?token=TlOteqjCAR2TBfnLhxiEt0fe2Cj9reOvrbTPsM3Epr8tmziQFDZs7y8P81xAxhiuoR8nfFLBXR4RNW_I-ebjWZo)

Wrist-worn? Check.
  
UI? Check.
  
Bluetooth? Check.
  
[Hypoallergenic](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/fitbit-allergy/)? Hopefully.
  
Price? Free (with a $12 annual subscription to their premium app &#8230; so that&#8217;s more like free-ish).

I&#8217;ve [long been predicting](https://draftin.com:443/images/22979?token=TlOteqjCAR2TBfnLhxiEt0fe2Cj9reOvrbTPsM3Epr8tmziQFDZs7y8P81xAxhiuoR8nfFLBXR4RNW_I-ebjWZo) that we&#8217;re going to see wearables (at least the non Apple variety) rapidly enter _Commodity Land_. It&#8217;s becoming more difficult to differentiate on features (although [FitBit is trying](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/10/22/leak-suggests-new-fitbit-surge-smartwatch-will-best-apple-watch-by-integrating-gps)), it&#8217;s hard to justify high prices for cheap innards, and all the action is in the software anyway. Now, for the dreaded self-quote:

> I predict that we&#8217;ll see these things [on discount] lining the shelves at your local drugstore. Just like paper towels. &#8212; [Me](http://drgarybennett.com/2014/07/22/how-are-fitness-trackers-like-paper-towels/)

Whoops, wrong quote. Try this one.

> Commoditization &#8230; will redirect the market&#8217;s focus where it should be: on the software. After all, the challenge isn&#8217;t the [data] collecting, it&#8217;s the changing. Tracker makers have done an excellent job in developing cool tools for gathering data, but they&#8217;ve been much less creative in designing software that reliably improves people&#8217;s health. And it&#8217;s the software that offers tracker makers the greatest opportunity for differentiation. &#8212; [Me](http://drgarybennett.com/2014/07/22/how-are-fitness-trackers-like-paper-towels/)

I haven&#8217;t yet used the Pivotal Living app and on first glance, I don&#8217;t see much that isn&#8217;t available in other apps. And remember, [we don&#8217;t know if any of these apps or devices actually work](http://drgarybennett.com/2013/06/14/why-digital-health-apps-dont-need-efficacy-data/). But, what&#8217;s important is that we&#8217;re beginning to see new business models for wearables that prize (and price) the software. If this business model catches on, I suspect that developers will need ways to better differentiate their apps. This might create opportunities for those of us who&#8217;ve been clamoring to get evidence-based approaches into the app market. Admittedly, that&#8217;s a lot of ifs, but I&#8217;m willing to play the long game because I&#8217;m convinced that focusing on the changing (vs. the collecting) will give us the best shot at using wearables to improve consumer health.
