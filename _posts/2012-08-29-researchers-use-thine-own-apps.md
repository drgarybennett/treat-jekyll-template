Really sage insight from <a href="http://davewiner.com/" target="_blank">Dave Winer</a>:

> This was a secret of mine, because most of my competitors not only didn&#8217;t listen to their users, but they didn&#8217;t even use their own products. If you want to make great products, never mind the degree in finance or marketing, though those skills are certainly important to running a business. Be both a user and a developer. That way you understand users, and you can make their dreams come true, because they are your dreams too. The reward for that is success.

I&#8217;ve often found it surprising that most researchers don&#8217;t actually spend very much time with their interventions. That&#8217;s a real problem. If we don&#8217;t use them, why do we expect that others will?
