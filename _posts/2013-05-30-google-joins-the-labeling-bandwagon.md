Google is bringing [nutrition data](http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/30/4379730/google-adds-nutrition-info-1000-foods-search-results) to their search results. 

> Starting today you will be able to quickly and easily find extensive nutrition information for over 1,000 fruits, vegetables, meats and meals in search.

Very nice.
