I&#8217;m as excited about the digital health revolution as the next person, but sometimes it&#8217;s worth reminding ourselves that we have <del datetime="2013-09-05T15:58:22+00:00">a lot of work to do</del> a major opportunity to reach broader population saturation.

The fine folks over at [App Annie](http://appannie.com) have amassed some great data on smartphone app popularity. Their data from the Google Play store show that MyFitnessPal was the most popular mHealth app during the past year. But how does MyFitnessPal rank, compared to the overall app market?

Not <del>so well</del> too bad, depending on your perspective. Here&#8217;s the thing &#8212; health communicators have long known what these data exemplify: for most people, health doesn&#8217;t rank very highly on the list of daily concerns (unless one is trying to get more healthy or deal with a health concern). With that in mind, it&#8217;s not really surprising that mHealth apps aren&#8217;t more popular. The <del>challenge</del> opportunity for mHealth app makers is [not only figuring out how to make apps that actually improve health], but determining how to integrate their content into apps that people actually use each day (e.g., games). 

Alternatively, we weight loss app makers need to figure out how to convince people that every day is January 2.
