We have a big surprise coming at this year's [SBM annual meeting](http://www.sbm.org/meetings/2018). Here are some hints:
* Rhymes with a great Stephen King book.
* Think of a fantastic former-Duke basketball player who startwed for the Sixers.
* One of things that's made Apple, Xerox, and Klennex famous. 

Stumped? Just hang around after the awards ceremony on Thursday evening (immediately following my talk). 

Hate guessing games? Read my editorial in this month's edition of [Outlook](https://www.sbm.org/publications/outlook). 

See you in NOLA!
