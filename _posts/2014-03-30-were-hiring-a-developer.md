_We&#8217;re launching a new digital health science center and are hiring the first member of our programming team. The job ad is below. Please share far and wide and contact us with any questions._

**Senior Analyst Programmer @ Duke Digital Health**

The mission of the Global Digital Health Science Center at Duke is to foster the design, evaluation, and dissemination of digital health innovations for low-income populations, worldwide.

The Center is looking for a creative Analyst Programmer, Sr. (that&#8217;s software engineer in Duke-speak) who will design and manage digital health technologies for Center projects. We&#8217;re looking for a creative all-around programmer with strong Ruby skills and comfort with both back-and front-end development.

Here&#8217;s who we&#8217;re looking for:

  * You&#8217;ve written a lot of Ruby and Rails code. You&#8217;re experienced developing public-facing web applications in Ruby on Rails and SQL.

  * You&#8217;re comfortable with front-end development using HTML/CSS/Javascript, especially jQuery. You love frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap, or Foundation.

  * You&#8217;re a SQL expert. You should understand normalization, joins, query optimization, views, stored procedures and triggers and when and how to use them.

  * You have experience with RESTful API design. You have used a range of popular APIs (extra points for Twilio, Twitter, and Facebook).
  * You&#8217;re extremely attentive to detail. You accept bugs as a fact of life, but are committed to their destruction. You write tests because you know it#s the right thing to do.
  * You can read code. You have experience working with unfamiliar code bases and can pick up where they left off.
  * You&#8217;re totally into application security. You don&#8217;t just read about security, you can do it, and talk about it. Pen testing is your friend. You can ensure that external and internal regulations governing data management are met.
  * You can stage a project and execute without managerial oversight.
  * You&#8217;re comfortable being a mentor to junior staff members.
