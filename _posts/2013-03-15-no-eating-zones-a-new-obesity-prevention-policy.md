Looks like the Italians (the Romans, no less) have [a new policy](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/9581090/Rome-tourists-face-500-fine-for-snacking.html) to reign in a primary American export: eating anywhere one wants.

You will now be fined for eating on or around Roman monuments (of course, one can still eat while walking, [but we Americans don&#8217;t really do much of thatÂ ](http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/data/facts.html)anyway).

In a Paris cafe a few years back, I had a great conversation about American eating habits. After overhearing my distinctly American brogue, a man began to share his thoughts about the New World and it&#8217;s boorish tendencies. He explained that the primary difference between Europeans and Americans was that we Yankees eat like pigs. The French, he said, would consider it &#8220;disgusting&#8221; to eat on the subway, in a bus, or while walking down the street. &#8220;You Americans will eat anything, anywhere!&#8221; 

That&#8217;s true, but we probably won&#8217;t be eating that way in Rome anymore. Or perhaps the Italians think they&#8217;ll fine enough Americans to solve their economic crisis.

All of this does make me wonder what kind of impact no-eating zones would have in the U.S. Much of our mindless eating of highly processed foods happens on the go. What if restricted public eating was the norm and not a newsworthy exception?
