Fantastic piece [in today&#8217;s Inside Stat](https://www.statnews.com/2016/11/03/genetic-testing-fitness-nutrition/).

I suspect that this will mostly be interpreted as an indictment of the athletics genetic testing &#8220;industry.&#8221; And, they seem to deserve it. But there&#8217;s a bigger issue here: many similar companies enter the market with laughably limited evidence that their &#8220;personalized recommendations&#8221; are actually informed by science.

So it wasn’t possible to compare the complete results from each company head-to-head.

The companies all gave me the same genetic readout on those variants, so I have little doubt they correctly analyzed the cells in the cheek swab I’d sent them. In six cases, however, the interpretation I got from one company directly contradicted the interpretation from another.

I&#8217;m sensitive to the idea that [the long time it takes to generate] evidence frequently slows the process of bringing innovative tools to market. However, this is a helpful reminder that speed can also disadvantage consumers (while rewarding founders).
