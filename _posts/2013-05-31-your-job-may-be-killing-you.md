No, I&#8217;m not link baiting again. If your job requires you to sit for long periods, it may indeed be killing you.

An interesting [new study](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1108810) from Australia reports the frightening health effects of sitting. Their conclusion:

> Prolonged sitting is significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality risk independent of physical activity.

Translation: Sitting seems to hurt health, whether you&#8217;re active or not. However, physically inactive sitters seem to have the highest death rates.

The study also reported:

> The population-attributable fraction of sitting time suggested that sitting was responsible for 6.9% of deaths.

Translation: Sitting isn&#8217;t a [huge death driver](http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/GBD/4/Table/4.4), but it&#8217;s an easy one to change.
