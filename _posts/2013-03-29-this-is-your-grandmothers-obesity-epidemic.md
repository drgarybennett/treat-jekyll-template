There is nothing new about the obesity epidemic.

Back in 1954, only around 5 million Americans were obese. Today, that number has grown to [nearly 100 million.](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db82.pdf)

There's a great piece over at [LIFE,](http://life.time.com/culture/obesity-in-the-usa-photos-from-the-early-fight-against-a-plague-1954/#ixzz2OpoPQvsl) which includes archived images from that 1954 issue, called, "The Plague of Overweight." (BTW, the LIFE archive is a national treasure, particularly for us armchair historians. It's a great reminder of how far modern media has fallen).

I sometimes ask audiences to tell when the obesity epidemic started. The usual answer is about 20-25 years ago. Nope. In fact, the obesity epidemic is much [much] older than most suspect.

That's the conclusion of a fascinating [new-to-me paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21561815) by John Komlos and Marek Brabec. They show that obesity rates skyrocketed after World War II. Blacks had the steepest climb &#8212; through 1965, obesity increased 71% among Black women and quadrupled among Black men. By the Vietnam era, obesity rates stabilized, but were still sky high for Blacks. 

So keep quiet the next time someone gets misty-eyed talking about how grandma made such wonderfully healthy meals in the good ol' days before obesity. You and I know that this is all grandma's fault anyway.
