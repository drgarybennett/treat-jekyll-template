It seems that Chick-Fil-A [is soon releasing a new, &#8220;healthier&#8221; line of salads](http://www.qsrweb.com/article/211571/Chick-fil-A-makes-over-salads-adds-calorie-counts-to-menu-boards).

The new salads look great. They&#8217;ll start at $6.79 and will have &#8220;two or more servings of vegetables or fruit,&#8221; (well that&#8217;s good, because it&#8217;s a salad). Sans dressing, the salads will come in at 180-430 calories.

That&#8217;s quite an improvement over the current salads, which range from 220-450 calories.

I&#8217;m not knocking Chick-Fil-A for calling these salads &#8220;healthy.&#8221; That&#8217;s probably true, compared to their other menu items. But the &#8220;health[ier]&#8221; fast food product is rarely also good for one&#8217;s waistline. Add dressing (which range from [15-160 calories](http://calorielab.com/restaurants/chick-fil-a/27)) and from a weight perspective, you might as well have eaten the chicken sandwich.
