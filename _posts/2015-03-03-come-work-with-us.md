I&#8217;m excited to announce that our center &#8212; [Duke Digital Health](http://dukedigitalhealth.org) &#8212; is recruiting a postdoctoral fellow, to start this summer/next fall. We&#8217;re looking for innovators who want create digital health interventions that work, scale, and serve high risk patients. Questions? [Bug me](http://drgarybennett.com/contact/ "Contact"). 

Here&#8217;s the announcement [_sorry it&#8217;s so dry &#8212; blame the lawyers_]:

**Postdoctoral Fellow**
  
The newly established Duke Global Digital Health Science Center is seeking a full-time postdoctoral fellow. Founded in 2014, the Duke Digital Health is the first of its kind — an integrated research program for the discovery, evaluation, and dissemination of digital health interventions for medically vulnerable populations. Our mission is to close health disparities using digital health. 

We are seeking a full-time postdoctoral fellow. This fellow will work for up to two years, while being mentored by Center faculty. We are open to applicants with expertise using any type of digital health intervention to address any health outcome. We invite applicants from a range of disciplinary backgrounds and varying levels of technical expertise. Ideally, the fellowship will begin in Fall 2015. The annual salary floor will be based on NIH guidelines. Successful applicants will have an earned doctorate (e.g., Ph.D., Sc.D., MD/MPH), with some training in quantitative methods. U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status is necessary due to funding requirements. 

Working with his/her mentors, the fellow will be expected to contribute to the Center’s ongoing efforts, while pursuing independent research activities. The fellow will be provided with professional development funds and will have access to the Center’s software engineering team. 

**Application instructions:**
  
Review of applications will begin by March 15 and will continue until the position is filled. Please include a cover letter with a statement of research interests, curriculum vitae, 1-2 sample publications, and two reference letters including one from the training director or doctoral committee chairperson/advisor.
