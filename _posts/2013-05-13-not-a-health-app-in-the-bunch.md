Here's a fascinating [list of the all time iOS apps](http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-reveals-new-all-time-top-apps-following-countdown-to-50-billion-downloads/). There's not a health app in the bunch. 

We have some work to do. 

(Interestingly, no health apps appeared on [last year's list](http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-reveals-new-all-time-top-apps-following-25-billion-downloads/) either. There was an app that [helps you gain weight](http://www.piviandco.com/apps/fatbooth/), but not one to help you lose it).
