It's been an incredible year, one that I could never have imagined. Many people have asked what makes me most proud about the past year. We've accomplished a great deal together: a new brand, industry meeting, podcast, grand rounds series, successful journal migration, and important work to better integrate ethics and diversity into our administrative structures. But I'm most proud of our members' heightened energy, activation, and commitment to improve the public's health.
