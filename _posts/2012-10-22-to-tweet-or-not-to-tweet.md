Interesting [new study](http://www.tandfonline.com/action/mobileChoice?originalRequestUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F10410236.2012.700391%3FjournalCode%3Dhhth20&userInterface=mobile) investigating how people perceive the credibility of those who tweet health/medical information. Their primary findings:

> &#8230;when a professional source with many followers tweets, participants tend to perceive the content to be more credible than when a layperson source with many followers tweets.

Translation: You&#8217;ll probably believe what I have to say it a bit more than the pizza guy who also has an interest in health behavior change. 

That&#8217;s a bit unfortunate, because the one of the often unstated advantages of Twitter is the potential leveling of the professional playing field &#8211; the quality of information should win out over the strength of one&#8217;s credentials.

> For retweets, however, the exact opposite pattern was found. 

Translation: When I retweet, my expert advantage diminishes. 

So for those of us who like to tweet about health and medical information, we should be reading the primary sources and developing original tweets. This is a really important reminder of what I think should be a best practice for health/medical study reporting on Twitter anyway. Given that we have overwhelming evidence that people often get details of complicated research studies wrong, it&#8217;s a dangerous game to retweet study findings. Reading the original source is critical.

That said, it&#8217;s not clear to me that losing expert advantage when retweeting is any more likely to happen for health/medicine folks then it is for any other professional domain.

One last thing &#8211; I know this has been repeated over and over, but it&#8217;s absolutely crazy that so many academic publishers impose paywalls on studies like this one. This is a primary barrier to our ability to break down walls between academia, Industry, and the public.
