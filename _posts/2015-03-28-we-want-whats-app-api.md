Faceboook&nbsp;[flustered many in the programming community](http://mashable.com/2015/03/26/whatsapp-developers/?utm_campaign=Feed%3A+mashable%2Ftech+%28Mashable+%C2%BB+Tech%29&utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-Tech-Partial&utm_medium=feed&utm_source=feedburner) this week, by not releasing an API for its popular WhatsApp service.

Here&#8217;s a sentiment shared by many developers: 

> &#8220;Implementing chat features is hard, especially when it comes down to sharing pictures, sounds etc.,&#8221; London-based iOS engineer Kevin Mindeguia explained to Mashable. &#8220;Itâ€™s actually one of those features you try to avoid as a developer, because of its complexity. Having a ready-to-use API and an SDK would save us great time and money.&#8221;

Count me among the flustered flock. WhatsApp is the conduit to vast populations globally &#8212; many of whom reside in areas that are resource constrained and have been historically disconnected. A WhatsApp API would be a huge win for digital health science efforts [like ours](http://www.dukedigitalhealth.org). We would immediately be able to provide remote, disconnected, medically vulnerable global populations with access to health interventions that would otherwise be inaccessible. Help us out, Facebook!
