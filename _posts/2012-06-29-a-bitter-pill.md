Let&#8217;s ignore for a moment the drug&#8217;s rather unimpressive outcomes ( <&#8211; couldn&#8217;t resist). Here&#8217;s the thing: over 6 months, a large number of [totally behavioral] strategies can produce enough weight loss to improve &#8212; and in some cases, prevent &#8212;  hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol.

What we can&#8217;t do is get people to keep the weight off (and drugs can&#8217;t do that either).

Let&#8217;s leave aside all of the issues associated with weight loss medications (safety, cost, safety, questionable efficacy, safety, cost, safety) &#8212; it&#8217;s always useful to have more tools in our arsenal. And there is certainly a subset of patients for whom weight loss drugs can be helpful.

The problem is that drugs help people lose weight. They don&#8217;t help you maintain that lost weight. You&#8217;re unlikely to take any weight loss drug in perpetuity (remember <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CHEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFenfluramine%2Fphentermine&ei=OyDuT8mzKI6Y8gTW_qyHAg&usg=AFQjCNFUdmeeJN2_2VxfWk3rgbzLVyMqMw" target="_blank">Fen-Phen</a>?). So, for long term maintenance, people need to learn the same behavioral strategies that can help with weight loss in the first place.

I&#8217;m sensitive to the idea that people want some help with losing weight. Drugs can definitely give you that extra <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1109220" target="_blank">bump</a>_. _However, [many studies](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1109220) show that over time &#8212; and even with that extra drug-induced bump &#8212; most people gain the weight back.
