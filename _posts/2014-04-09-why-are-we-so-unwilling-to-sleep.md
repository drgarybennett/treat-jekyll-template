[Very cool device](http://wearvigo.com/), but doesn&#8217;t this say everything our horrible sleep behaviors? 

Reminds me of a great spot that 60 Minutes did with noted sleep researcher, Eve Van Cauter, a few years ago:

> &#8230;I find it amazing to see how many people are asleep within five minutes of boarding an airplane at 11 o&#8217;clock in the morning. You know, sit down and boom. It shouldn&#8217;t happen. A normal adult shouldn&#8217;t be falling asleep at 11 o&#8217;clock in the morning, minutes after sitting in a small, uncomfortable airplane seat. It just shows that, you know, people are exhausted.
