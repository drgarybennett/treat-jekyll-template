Interesting [new piece](http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/pdf/1479-5868-10-46.pdf) from Kimberly Morland and colleagues that looks at how the Brooklyn retail food environment changed during 2007-2011. 

**Key finding**: lots of smaller food stores closed, many of those were replaced by new stores, and this was all more likely to happen in lower income and racial/ethnic minority neighborhoods. 

What does this mean for obesity? We don't know yet.

Having supermarkets nearby might be a driver of diet quality, but there is less evidence that they impact obesity. There's even less evidence that changing the retail environment (e.g. opening a new supermarket) will lead to changes in resident's eating behaviors. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't consider policy solutions to improve food deserts, but it's clear that their impact on our waistlines isn't as straightforward as we might expect.
