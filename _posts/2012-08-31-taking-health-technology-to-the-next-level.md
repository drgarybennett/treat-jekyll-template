I was honored to speak at theÂ 2012 <a href="http://conferences.thehillgroup.com/OBSSRinstitutes/TIDIRH2012/index.html" target="_blank">Training Institute on Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (TIDIRH)</a>. I ranted for 45min about the science of disseminating electronic health technologies. Let me know what you think.

You can find a pdf of the slides <a href="http://conferences.thehillgroup.com/OBSSRinstitutes/TIDIRH2012/presentations/Day4_Bennett_eHealth%20and%20D&I.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that I had to drop all of the fun stuff.
