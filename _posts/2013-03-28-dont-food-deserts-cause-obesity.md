True or false? 

_In order to best contend with the obesity epidemic (which disproportionately affects the poor), we should learn the lesson of tobacco control and broadly institute policies that reduce food deserts, make healthful foods inexpensive, and neighborhoods safe for physical activity._ 

If you've spent any time in public-health circles, you are probably nodding your head in solidarity with this statement. But is it true?

Helen Lee presents a contrarian view in her [new report](http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/journal/issue-3/the-making-of-the-obesity-epidemic/) for _Breakthrough Journal_. Here's how [Marc Ambinder](http://theweek.com/article/index/241855/getting-obesity-wrong) described Lee's piece: 

> Helen Lee suggests that instead of assuming that poor people have no agency, that they fewer access to resources, and that they cannot shape the world around them, policy-makers would be better off finding ways to reinforce healthy choices, rather than to punish unhealthy ones, or to treat a group of people as automatons who can't stop eating their Butterfingers.

Lee's piece is a must read. And not because she's right. I think she's missing a few crucial pieces here (notably, that the effects of income on obesity vary dramatically between racial/ethnic and geographic groups), but it's critically important that the public health community challenges its interpretations of the evidence, particularly when costly trade offs are involved. As Lee argues:

> For the poor, the problem has less to do with food deserts and more to do with income deserts, college degree deserts, and quality health care deserts. Empowering the poor to take control of their social, economic, and health circumstances requires changing the larger life settings and socioeconomic circumstances that situate agency and habit setting. If the goal is to reduce poverty and create opportunities for advancement, then building grocery stores in the inner city should be evaluated against other antipoverty strategies, like increasing income transfers, workforce development services, and improved preschool and early learning opportunities alongside higher-education funding.

Exactly.
