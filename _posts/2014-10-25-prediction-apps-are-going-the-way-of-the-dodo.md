[Interesting piece](http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2014/10/24/the_future_of_mobile_apps_looks_bad.html) in Slate today about the demise of the mobile app.

> &#8230; apps are very clearly not going to be around forever. Certainly not in their current, bulky square form. There isn&#8217;t enough mobile homepage real estate for each of the web&#8217;s 500-million-plus active websites to have its own app&#8230;

(The comments section &#8212; this time &#8212; is worth checking out)

This may seem like an extreme [read: click baiting] position, but the author has a point. With change in hardware configs (big phones with big screens, watches with small ones), we&#8217;re likely to see evolution in app interface designs as well.

My prediction? Hate to say it, but I think iOS 8&#8217;s &#8220;new&#8221; widget functionality portends where we might be going. I suspect apps will live in the background and/or cloud, with minimal interfaces, push notifications that are triggered by inputs, context, and biology, with as-needed full &#8220;screen&#8221; experiences.

The days of icons arrayed in rows and columns will be over sooner than we might expect.
