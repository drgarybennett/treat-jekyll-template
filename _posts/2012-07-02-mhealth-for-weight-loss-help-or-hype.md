Dr. Sherry Pagoto is [totally right](http://t.co/ywjfa8GU) about the limitations of mobile apps for weight loss. The whole piece is worth a read, but this point is key:

> The vast majority of apps are tools for weight, diet, and activity tracking. Apps do a great job here, but these strategies represent a very small segment of a much larger body of effective behavioral strategies that are used to help people lose weight. The situation is tantamount to asking someone to build a house but giving them only a hammer.

As I&#8217;ve mentioned, [app form is critical](http://drgarybennett.com/2012/07/02/ehealth-form-vs-function/) but function is what gets the job done.
