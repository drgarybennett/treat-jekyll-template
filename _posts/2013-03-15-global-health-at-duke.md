You might have heard that we just established a [new global health major at Duke](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&cad=rja&ved=0CHcQFjAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dukechronicle.com%2Farticles%2F2013%2F03%2F08%2Fduke-arts-and-sciences-council-approves-global-health-co-major&ei=nxFDUYGUG7Oj4APnqoGYAw&usg=AFQjCNHnsBGfn6M1Fq7n6_NGHzFFrQIDZg&bvm=bv.43828540,d.dmg). It will be one of the first [liberal arts global health majors](http://globalhealth.duke.edu/education/major-overview) in the country.

It&#8217;s going to be awesome.

I was asked to speak about the major and well&#8230; I just had too much to say&#8230; Or not.
