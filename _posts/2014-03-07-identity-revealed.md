Okay, maybe this wasn&#8217;t as big as revealing the identity of the Bitcoin developer, but Politico just [doxed](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=doxed) [the guy who created the new Nutrition Facts Label](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/new-food-labels-fda-kevin-grady-104412.html#ixzz2vIDIOkGQ). Rather than going with a public health type, FDA [somewhat surprisingly] engaged Kevin Grady, a director at leading design firm IDEO.

> Perhaps that’s why Grady&#8230;was not afraid to take a slightly unconventional approach and venture outside design norms, in part by blowing up the font size for calorie counts on nutrition labels from 8- to an eye-popping 24-point font, making the number even larger than the “Nutrition Facts” text.

They&#8217;re right. Calories have gained weight, just like the rest of us. In this case, that&#8217;s a good thing.

That said, I&#8217;m a bit surprised that FDA retained so much of the old label format. The copious use of percentages would drive a health communication scientist crazy. FDA seems not to accept the data showing that [low numeracy is a major U.S. health challenge](http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/64/167052/Numeracy-Reyna.pdf). Indeed, [most Americans](https://nces.ed.gov/naal/kf_demographics.asp) have numeracy levels at or below the basic level of proficiency. If I need to teach you how to read a label &#8212; and that&#8217;s exactly what we do in today&#8217;s weight management programs &#8212; it probably doesn&#8217;t work.

It would have been nice to see a more revolutionary change in the new label. Just look at the infographic that FDA uses to explain the changes.

That said, the new label is an important step in the right direction. And it must be nice being the Jony Ive of public health.
