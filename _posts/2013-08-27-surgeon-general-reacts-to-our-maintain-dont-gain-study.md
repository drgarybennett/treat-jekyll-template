We were thrilled that Surgeon General Regina Benjamin responded to our <a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1731966" target="_blank">recent study</a> on the &#8220;maintain, don&#8217;t gain&#8221; obesity treatment approach we tested in our <a href="http://www.dukeobesity.org/?portfolio=shape" target="_blank">Shape research trial</a>. In a special invited commentary in JAMA Internal Medicine, Dr. Benjamin called the approach &#8220;promising&#8221; and further noted:

> We can envision a time when such interventions for preventing weight gain as well as successful interventions for weight loss are provided under the leadership of primary care physicians, while the broader community receives an intervention program of education and environmental change, including effective strategies in worksites, schools, and community organizations. Combining clinical and community approaches may offer the best hope for helping our nationâ€™s citizens achieve and maintain a healthy weight.

We couldn&#8217;t agree more.
