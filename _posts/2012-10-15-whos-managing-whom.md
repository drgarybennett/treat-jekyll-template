At a career development panel at last year&#8217;s [ridiculously wonderful] [Society of Behavioral Medicine](http://www.sbm.org) meeting, an attendee asked about how we manage our email workflow. Ha! At that point, I felt like I should&#8217;ve walked off the stage &#8212; I have no credibility on this issue. I&#8217;ve been using email since about 1988 and I&#8217;ve never developed an effective process for managing it.

That said, I mentioned a few strategies that I&#8217;m currently practicing:

  * <a href="http://www.inboxzero.com" target="_blank">Inbox zero</a> <&#8211; at which I fail, daily
  * I moved all my work email to Gmail, mostly because searching is better than foldering messages. Indeed <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5848244/email-folders-might-actually-decrease-productivity-searching-for-old-emails-is-just-as-fast" target="_blank">foldering might just be dangerous</a>.
  * I use the really nice app &#8212; <a href="http://www.hitmelater.com" target="_blank">Hit Me Later</a>, which allows me to try to get to Inbox Zero (note my propensity to failing) by delaying emails until a more opportune time.

Despite my best efforts, I still am overflowing in email.

So I&#8217;m adding a new approach. Just about everyone has a version of the [Touch It Once](http://beyondthedefaults.com/2012/05/the-first-rule-of-email-touch-it-once/) approach to email management. I&#8217;ve ignored it for too long because it just seemed too ubiquitous a recommendation to be useful. It&#8217;s like all those secret weight loss approaches. Come on &#8212; at this point, could anyone really keep an effective weight loss approach secret? 

Yeah, well, I was wrong. I&#8217;ve been using this with some success in the past few weeks, combined with the other tools I mentioned. So here&#8217;s how it goes. As soon as I open an email, I do something with it. Respond, delegate, delete, archive, <a href="http://www.hitmelater.com" target="_blank">delay</a>. But whatever I do &#8212; I don&#8217;t leave it untouched, sitting in the inbox. 

This has meant the need to shut off all of my mobile device notification features. The pull to check and respond to email is just too great. This means that I only check email when I have enough time to respond. Given the demands of my day, that&#8217;s meant checking/responding usually twice daily. Yup, twice. And weird times at that. 

Using this approach, I&#8217;ve found that my optimal response times are usually around 10am (assuming I don&#8217;t have a meeting) and about 9pm, after my daughter goes down. And a final rule is that I don&#8217;t respond first thing in the morning. That time is better spent doing real work. 

So there, friends, is a more complete response to how I &#8220;manage&#8221; email. Truth is, I think email&#8217;s doing a far better job managing me.
