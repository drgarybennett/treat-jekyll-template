Please listen to [this piece](https://www.interactivehealthinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Podcast-B2B-Thumbnails-003-final-final.jpg) for Interactive Health’s *To Health With It* podcast. After some interviews, I cringe in fear that I’ve missed the mark and failed to argue the point clearly. Most times, I don’t even listen to the produced piece. To be clear, I’m not sure that I *was* clear here, but I did say what I believe (which is a start): taxpayers deserve dissemination and the marketplace is usually the best avenue. Our failure to commercialize innovations reflects misaligned incentives, not ill motives. If we ultimately want to improve health we must be willing to talk across the table, confront our biases, and place the interests of patients and populations first.
