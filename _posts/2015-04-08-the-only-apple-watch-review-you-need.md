Lots of Apple watch [reviews](http://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review) [are](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/technology/personaltech/apple-watch-bliss-but-only-after-a-steep-learning-curve.html?_r=0) [out](http://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch) today.

(If you&#8217;re short on time, read [Gruber&#8217;s review](http://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch))

Taken together, the [early reviews](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-watch-reviews-are-bad-2015-4) have been the tech equivalent of the multipurpose Southern maxim, &#8220;bless your heart.&#8221;

Apple Watch apparently needs work, even if no one wants to say it directly. From the NYTs [Manjoo](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/technology/personaltech/apple-watch-bliss-but-only-after-a-steep-learning-curve.html?_r=0)):

> &#8220;The most exciting thing about the Apple Watch isn’t the device itself, but the new tech vistas that may be opened by the first mainstream wearable computer&#8230;For now, the dreams are hampered by the harsh realities of a new device.&#8221;

From [Gruber:](http://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch)

> &#8220;To me, the breakthrough in Apple Watch is the Taptic Engine and force touch. Technically, they’re two separate things. The Taptic Engine allows Apple Watch to tap you; force touch allows Apple Watch to recognize a stronger press from your finger.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;And without taps, Apple Watch is rather dull.&#8221;

Call me contrary, but I think these reviews are pretty exciting. They sound precisely like those of the first iPhone.
