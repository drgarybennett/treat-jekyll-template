This new-to-me piece by <a href="http://www.hudson.org/cardello" target="_blank">Hank Cardello</a> details the financial performance of a select group of food companies that offer BFY (better for you) products. (Hank is an interesting guy – a former food company executive who is an <a href="http://www.stuffednation.com/" target="_blank">outspoken advocate</a> for strategies to reduce the obesity epidemic). The study summary:

> The message was clear: companies can make money while selling healthier products.

The full report is worth a close look. I&#8217;m a bit dubious about the methods, but it&#8217;s an important contribution nonetheless. The key finding:

> &#8230;we found that stocks of companies with the larger percentage of their sales in BFY products grew at over 3 times the rate compared to those companies selling a smaller percent of BFY products (+3.4% vs. +1.1%, respectively).

This line of argument – doing good = good business – is one that the public health community should embrace.  Sure, it&#8217;s perhaps an unnatural extension of social entrepreneurism movement, but its potential impact is is arguably greater.
