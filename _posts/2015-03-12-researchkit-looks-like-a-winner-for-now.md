Here&#8217;s a researchers dream: Wake up one morning and find that [11,000 people](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/apple-researchkit-sees-thousands-sign-up-amid-bias-criticism) have signed up for your latest study.

> “To get 10,000 people enrolled in a medical study normally, it would take a year and 50 medical centers around the country,” said Alan Yeung, medical director of Stanford Cardiovascular Health. “That’s the power of the phone.”

Here&#8217;s a researchers nightmare: Losing 80% of those 11,000.

Out of the gate, ResearchKit appears to be a smashing success. However, there&#8217;s a problem &#8212; with most mobile apps (particularly those that are commercialized by the download or rewarded for large user bases), the crucial question is &#8220;_if you build it will they come?_&#8221;

The problem is that with research, particularly longitudinal research studies, there&#8217;s another [much more important] question: &#8220;_if you build it, will they stay?_&#8220;
