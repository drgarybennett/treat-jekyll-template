Good science + good friends + wanting to do good + good-ish caffeine + good [hard] work + good luck = Scale Down.

I’m thrilled that our labor of love has been acquired by Anthem. I’ll have a lot more to say soon, but let’s go with this for now:

Thanks, Kate.
Thanks, Dori.
Thanks, Leah.
Thanks, Users.
Thanks, Starbucks (they open early).
