And no, I&#8217;m not talking about the [tournament](http://www.goduke.com) (although Duke&#8217;s a lock).

I&#8217;m talking about [RWJs County Health Rankings](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org), which were released last week. My fair home county &#8212; Wake &#8212; came out on top. Wake was [named North Carolina&#8217;s most healthy county](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/north-carolina/2013/rankings/outcomes/overall/by-rank)Â for the **4th** year in a row.

The news raised lots of excitement:

All very exciting, right? Not exactly. Here&#8217;s why. 

When I look at the top 10 NC counties in the County Health Rankings report, one thing stands out. Socioeconomic advantage. 

The table below shows the 10 healthiest NC counties in the County Health Rankings. For each, I also show whether the county is in the [top 10 for several important socioeconomic indicators](http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml): median household income, proportion with more than high school education, lowest number in poverty, and highest home values.  [table caption=&#8221;&#8221; width=&#8221;550&#8243; colwidth=&#8221;150,100,100,100,100,100&#8243; colalign=&#8221;left|center|center|center|center|center|&#8221;] County,Rank,Income,Education,Low Poverty,Home value

[/table] 

As you can see, the 10 healthiest NC counties are among of the most socioeconomically advantaged in the state. I&#8217;m not criticizing the County Health Rankings methodology. From what I can tell, their strategy is extremely sound. Their findings simply reflect what we&#8217;ve long known &#8212; socioeconomic factors are potent drivers of community health. 

That said, it would be really exciting to identify socioeconomically disadvantaged counties that still experience positive health outcomes. It just might take us a while to find them. 

In the meantime, these data illustrate a troubling truism &#8212; _if you want to live in a healthy county, go find a rich one._
