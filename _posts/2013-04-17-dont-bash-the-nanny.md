KevinMD has a [great new piece](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2013/04/nanny-state-mentality-hurts-public-health.html) from [Sherry Pagoto](http://www.twitter.com/drsherrypagoto).

> Somewhere along the line “nanny” has become a bad word&#8230;The problem with the “nanny state” mentality is that in the past many health policies have been very effective, so this new kneejerk reaction against health policy may prevent us from passing legislation that stands to significantly impact public health.

Exactly. Let&#8217;s stop the [nanny name-calling](http://drgarybennett.com/2013/03/18/nanny-state-fascist/) and use our vast amounts of [taxpayer-funded] data to inform our decision making.
