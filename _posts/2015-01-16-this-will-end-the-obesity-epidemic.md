I&#8217;m pretty open-minded when it comes to food. And I&#8217;m first in line to try a new obesity treatment, but&#8230;[haggis?](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-30834196)

Turns out that a British MP wants the U.S. to drop its import ban on haggis. Why? Because, public health.

> He claimed haggis &#8220;satisfied hunger very much more than the junk food which Americans consume&#8221;. The surgeon and former shadow health minister&#8230;claimed that haggis consumption would help deal with the &#8220;obesity epidemic&#8221; in the US.

So there you have it. Haggis &#8211; a lovely delicacy [containing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggis), &#8220;sheep&#8217;s pluck (heart, liver and lungs); minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and traditionally encased in the animal&#8217;s stomach and simmered for approximately three hours&#8221; &#8211; is the answer. Clearly, the metabolic benefits of the pluck combined with the brown fat promoted by the suet, and the oatmeal-induced GI motility produces rapid weight loss. This must be why the Scots have some of the lowest rates of obesity globally&#8230;uhh, maybe not.
